<meta name=keywords content><meta name=description content="Hello, I&rsquo;m Wouter Haverals
I&rsquo;m a researcher and software engineer working at the intersection of computational methods and literary-historical research. My work focuses on creating innovative approaches to study cultural heritage through digital humanities methodologies.
Professional Focus
My work spans the intersection of computational methods and literary-historical research, creating innovative approaches to study cultural heritage. I focus on:

Applying digital humanities methodologies to historical texts across languages and time periods
Developing open-source tools for manuscript analysis and transcription
Building bridges between traditional philological scholarship and computational approaches
Exploring patterns of textual transmission and literary development through data-driven methods
Democratizing access to cultural heritage through digital frameworks

Skills
Experience Highlights

Designed and implemented CERberus, an open-source tool for evaluating HTR systems (nominated for Best DH Tool, 2023)
Led the digital transcription of the complete manuscript collection from the Carthusian monastery of Herne (14th century)
Served as Programme Chair for the Computational Humanities Research Conference 2024
Contributed the Middle Dutch component to CATMuS, a multilingual dataset for HTR research across European languages
Developed innovative computational approaches to analyze medieval poetic meter and rhythm

Education

PhD in Language and Literature, University of Antwerp (2019)
Master of Arts in Language and Literature, University of Antwerp (2014, Magna Cum Laude)
Teacher Training Program, University of Antwerp (2015, Magna Cum Laude)
Bachelor of Arts in Dutch and English Language and Literature, University of Antwerp (2013, Cum Laude)
Exchange Program, Hamilton High School, Wisconsin, USA (2009-2010)
