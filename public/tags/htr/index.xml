&lt;h2 id="overview">Overview&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I contributed the Middle Dutch component to CATMuS (Comprehensive Archive of Transcribed Multilingual Sources), a pioneering multilingual dataset for Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) research across European languages. This collaborative project brings together manuscript data from multiple languages, periods, and scribal traditions to enable more robust cross-lingual HTR research.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-challenge">The Challenge&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Handwritten Text Recognition systems have traditionally been developed for specific languages or even specific manuscript collections, limiting their applicability across the diversity of historical documents. CATMuS was created to address this fragmentation by providing a standardized, comprehensive dataset spanning multiple languages.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>CERberus: HTR Evaluation Tool</title><link>https://whaverals.github.io/projects/project-1/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 May 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://whaverals.github.io/projects/project-1/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="cerberus-handwritten-text-recognition-evaluation-tool">CERberus: Handwritten Text Recognition Evaluation Tool&lt;/h1>
&lt;h2 id="overview">Overview&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>CERberus is an open-source tool I designed and implemented for evaluating Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) systems. The project was nominated for Best DH Tool in 2023 and has become an important resource for digital humanities researchers working with historical manuscripts.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="challenge">Challenge&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Evaluating the quality of automated transcriptions from historical manuscripts is complex, requiring specialized metrics that account for historical spelling variations, scribal abbreviations, and language-specific features. Existing tools were either too simplistic (focusing only on Character Error Rate) or too specialized for broader adoption.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Digital Approaches to Medieval Manuscripts</title><link>https://whaverals.github.io/posts/my-first-post/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://whaverals.github.io/posts/my-first-post/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="digital-approaches-to-medieval-manuscripts">Digital Approaches to Medieval Manuscripts&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>The intersection of digital technologies and historical manuscript studies has opened new horizons for understanding our textual heritage. As someone working in this interdisciplinary space, I&amp;rsquo;d like to share some reflections on the challenges and opportunities of applying computational methods to medieval texts.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-digital-humanities-revolution">The Digital Humanities Revolution&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Medieval manuscript studies has undergone a transformation in recent decades through digital approaches. What was once a discipline limited by physical access to rare materials has become increasingly democratized through:&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
