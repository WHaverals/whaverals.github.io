The intersection of digital technologies and historical manuscript studies has opened new horizons for understanding our textual heritage. As someone working in this interdisciplinary space, I&rsquo;d like to share some reflections on the challenges and opportunities of applying computational methods to medieval texts.

Medieval manuscript studies has undergone a transformation in recent decades through digital approaches.
