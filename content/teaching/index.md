# Teaching Philosophy & Courses

My teaching integrates digital methods with traditional humanities scholarship, creating opportunities for students to engage with historical texts and cultural heritage through both close and distant reading approaches.

## Current Courses

### Digital Approaches to Medieval Manuscripts
*Princeton University, Spring 2025*

This course introduces students to computational methods for analyzing medieval manuscripts. Students learn how to:
- Apply Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) to historical documents
- Create digital editions using TEI XML encoding
- Analyze textual patterns using computational stylometry
- Visualize manuscript networks and textual relationships

### Introduction to Digital Humanities
*Princeton University, Fall 2024*

An introductory course covering fundamental concepts and methodologies in digital humanities:
- Text analysis and text mining techniques
- Data visualization for humanities research
- Digital archives and collections
- Critical approaches to digital tools and methods

## Past Courses

### Medieval Literature in the Digital Age
*University of Antwerp, 2018-2019*

This course examined how digital tools can enhance our understanding of medieval literary texts, focusing on:
- Computational analysis of medieval poetry
- Digital scholarly editing
- Visualization of narrative structures
- Multilingual corpus analysis

### Text as Data: From Medieval Manuscripts to Machine Learning
*Summer Institute, 2017*

An intensive workshop introducing humanities scholars to computational text analysis techniques, covering:
- Preparing textual data for computational analysis
- Basic programming for text processing
- Statistical methods for text analysis
- Applying machine learning to historical texts

## Student Projects

I believe in project-based learning that produces meaningful scholarly outputs. Some notable student projects include:

- **Digital Edition of Carthusian Manuscript Collection**: A collaborative project creating TEI-encoded editions of previously unedited texts
- **Computational Analysis of Medieval Meter**: Using algorithmic approaches to detect metrical patterns across a corpus of Middle Dutch poetry
- **Visualization of Manuscript Networks**: Interactive network visualization showing relationships between manuscripts, scribes, and textual traditions

## Teaching Resources

I'm committed to open educational resources. My teaching materials, including syllabi, tutorials, and code notebooks, are available on my [GitHub repository](https://github.com/whaverals/teaching-resources).
