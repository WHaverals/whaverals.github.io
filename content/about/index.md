## Hello, I'm Wouter Haverals

I'm a researcher and software engineer working at the intersection of computational methods and literary-historical research. My work focuses on creating innovative approaches to study cultural heritage through digital humanities methodologies.

### Professional Focus

My work spans the intersection of computational methods and literary-historical research, creating innovative approaches to study cultural heritage. I focus on:

- Applying digital humanities methodologies to historical texts across languages and time periods
- Developing open-source tools for manuscript analysis and transcription
- Building bridges between traditional philological scholarship and computational approaches
- Exploring patterns of textual transmission and literary development through data-driven methods
- Democratizing access to cultural heritage through digital frameworks

### Skills

- **Programming**: Python, R, JavaScript, SQL, XML/TEI
- **Digital Humanities**: HTR (Handwritten Text Recognition), stylometry, computational literary analysis, digital scholarly editing
- **Data Science**: Machine learning, statistical analysis, data visualization, natural language processing
- **Historical Linguistics**: Middle Dutch, Middle French, Medieval Latin, historical language processing
- **Languages**: Dutch (native), English (professional), French (advanced), German (intermediate), Latin (reading)
- **Project Management**: Research team coordination, international collaboration, grant writing

### Experience Highlights

- Designed and implemented CERberus, an open-source tool for evaluating HTR systems (nominated for Best DH Tool, 2023)
- Led the digital transcription of the complete manuscript collection from the Carthusian monastery of Herne (14th century)
- Served as Programme Chair for the Computational Humanities Research Conference 2024
- Contributed the Middle Dutch component to CATMuS, a multilingual dataset for HTR research across European languages
- Developed innovative computational approaches to analyze medieval poetic meter and rhythm

### Education

- PhD in Language and Literature, University of Antwerp (2019)
- Master of Arts in Language and Literature, University of Antwerp (2014, Magna Cum Laude)
- Teacher Training Program, University of Antwerp (2015, Magna Cum Laude)
- Bachelor of Arts in Dutch and English Language and Literature, University of Antwerp (2013, Cum Laude)
- Exchange Program, Hamilton High School, Wisconsin, USA (2009-2010)

### Connect

I'm always interested in new collaborations at the intersection of humanities and technology. Whether you're working on manuscript digitization, computational literary analysis, or exploring new applications of AI for cultural heritage, I'd love to discuss potential projects and partnerships.
