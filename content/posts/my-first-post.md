# Welcome to My Portfolio Website!

I'm excited to share my journey, projects, and thoughts with you through this platform. This site will serve as a hub for my professional work, personal projects, and blog posts about technology and other interests.

## What to Expect

On this site, you'll find:

- **Projects**: Detailed breakdowns of my technical projects with links to code repositories
- **Blog Posts**: Thoughts, tutorials, and insights about technology, programming, and data science
- **About Me**: My professional background, skills, and experience

## Why Hugo with PaperMod?

I chose to build this site with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and the [PaperMod](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod) theme for several reasons:

1. **Speed**: Hugo is one of the fastest static site generators available
2. **Simplicity**: Markdown-based content creation makes writing posts easy
3. **Customization**: PaperMod offers a clean, minimal design with plenty of customization options
4. **Performance**: Static sites load quickly and are highly efficient

## Future Plans

I plan to regularly update this site with new projects and blog posts. Some upcoming topics include:

- Technical deep dives into projects I'm working on
- Tutorials on tools and technologies I use
- Reflections on my learning journey

Stay tuned for more content coming soon!
