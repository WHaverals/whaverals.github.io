# Carthusian Digital Archive: Herne Manuscript Collection

## Overview

This project involved leading the digital transcription and analysis of the complete manuscript collection from the Carthusian monastery of Herne (14th century). This comprehensive digital archive makes accessible an important corpus of Middle Dutch texts that have significant historical and linguistic value.

## Historical Significance

The Carthusian monastery of Herne was a major center for manuscript production and translation in the 14th century, responsible for introducing numerous Latin works to the Low Countries through vernacular translations. These manuscripts represent a crucial phase in the development of scholarly Middle Dutch and reflect important cultural exchanges in medieval Europe.

## Project Scope

- Complete digital transcription of 43 manuscripts (over 6,000 pages)
- Development of specialized TEI encoding schema for Middle Dutch manuscript features
- Integration of manuscript images with diplomatic transcriptions
- Linguistic annotation for lexical and syntactic analysis
- Creation of searchable database with advanced query options
- Development of computational tools for analyzing scribal hands and textual relationships

## Technical Implementation

- XML/TEI encoding for all transcriptions with standardized markup
- Custom HTR models trained for Middle Dutch gothic script
- Database implementation with specialized historical linguistic search capabilities
- Image-text alignment system for manuscript visualization
- Web interface for research access and public engagement
- Computational stylometry for scribal hand identification

## Research Outcomes

This project has enabled:

- First comprehensive linguistic analysis of the Herne translation corpus
- Identification of previously unknown textual relationships
- Statistical analysis of linguistic features and their evolution
- New insights into the standardization processes in Middle Dutch
- Digital preservation of cultural heritage materials
- Creation of a multilingual parallel corpus for historical translation studies

## Collaborative Approach

The project involved collaboration with:
- Historical linguists and philologists
- Paleography specialists
- Computer scientists specializing in HTR
- Library conservators
- Cultural heritage institutions

## Impact

The Carthusian Digital Archive has become a valuable resource for medieval studies, historical linguistics, and digital humanities. It has been integrated into university curricula, cited in numerous scholarly publications, and serves as a model for similar manuscript digitization efforts.
