# CERberus: Handwritten Text Recognition Evaluation Tool

## Overview

CERberus is an open-source tool I designed and implemented for evaluating Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) systems. The project was nominated for Best DH Tool in 2023 and has become an important resource for digital humanities researchers working with historical manuscripts.

## Challenge

Evaluating the quality of automated transcriptions from historical manuscripts is complex, requiring specialized metrics that account for historical spelling variations, scribal abbreviations, and language-specific features. Existing tools were either too simplistic (focusing only on Character Error Rate) or too specialized for broader adoption.

## Features

- Comprehensive evaluation metrics beyond simple Character Error Rate
- Support for historical language peculiarities across multiple European languages
- Visualization tools for error analysis and transcription comparison
- Integration with major HTR platforms (Transkribus, eScriptorium)
- Batch processing capabilities for large manuscript collections
- Specialized handling of abbreviations, punctuation, and character normalization

## Technologies Used

- Python (core implementation)
- Natural Language Processing libraries
- Statistical analysis tools
- Interactive visualizations with Plotly
- XML/TEI processing capabilities

## Methodology

The development of CERberus involved:

1. Extensive collaboration with historical linguists and paleographers
2. Analysis of common error patterns in HTR outputs across languages
3. Implementation of specialized algorithms for historical text comparison
4. Rigorous testing with manuscript collections from different periods and regions
5. Iterative refinement based on user feedback from the DH community

## Impact

CERberus has been adopted by research teams across Europe working on manuscript digitization projects. It has enabled:

- More accurate evaluation of HTR model performance on historical texts
- Better understanding of language-specific challenges in historical text recognition
- Improved model training through detailed error analysis
- Standardization of evaluation practices in the digital humanities community

## Future Development

Ongoing work includes expanding language support, implementing more sophisticated linguistic analysis features, and creating plugins for additional HTR platforms.
