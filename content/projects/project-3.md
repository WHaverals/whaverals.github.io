# CATMuS: Multilingual Dataset for HTR Research

## Overview

I contributed the Middle Dutch component to CATMuS (Comprehensive Archive of Transcribed Multilingual Sources), a pioneering multilingual dataset for Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) research across European languages. This collaborative project brings together manuscript data from multiple languages, periods, and scribal traditions to enable more robust cross-lingual HTR research.

## The Challenge

Handwritten Text Recognition systems have traditionally been developed for specific languages or even specific manuscript collections, limiting their applicability across the diversity of historical documents. CATMuS was created to address this fragmentation by providing a standardized, comprehensive dataset spanning multiple languages.

## The Middle Dutch Component

My contribution focused on the Middle Dutch corpus, which included:

- Selection of representative manuscripts from the 13th-16th centuries
- Creation of diplomatic transcriptions following standardized guidelines
- Detailed linguistic annotation of Middle Dutch features
- Paleographic classification of script types
- Metadata enrichment documenting provenance, dating, and content
- Alignment of text and images at line and word level

## Technical Implementation

- Development of specialized encoding schema for Middle Dutch linguistic features
- Implementation of quality control processes for transcription accuracy
- Creation of standardized annotation guidelines for historical abbreviations
- Application of computational methods for script classification
- Integration with the broader multilingual dataset structure

## Research Applications

The CATMuS dataset has enabled:

- Development of more robust multilingual HTR models
- Comparative studies of historical script evolution across language boundaries
- Research into transfer learning techniques for low-resource historical languages
- Benchmark evaluations for HTR performance across different scribal traditions
- Studies of language-specific challenges in automated transcription

## Collaboration

The project involved coordination with research teams across Europe, establishing common standards while accounting for language-specific features. My role included harmonizing the Middle Dutch component with parallel work on other languages including Medieval Latin, Middle French, Middle High German, and Middle English.

## Impact

CATMuS has become an essential resource for HTR research and development, particularly for:
- Model developers working on multilingual HTR systems
- Digital humanities researchers working across language boundaries
- Cultural heritage institutions with diverse manuscript collections
- Computer scientists researching transfer learning for historical documents
